# Git-notes advanced topics
While git-notes are really simple to get started with, more advanced techniques can make them more effective.

# Public notes
Making one or more of your git-notes repos public, let's share your knowledge with others and get feedback from them.

## Making a repo public
A repo can be changed from private to public. For GitHub, see [Making a repository public](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility#making-a-repository-public).

## Adding a copyright or license
A copyright or license allows others to use your notes in ways that you intend, while protecting it from unauthorized uses.

Adding a copyright is as simple as adding the copyright symbol, the year, and your name to your README.md file. See [How Do I Correctly Format a Copyright?](https://info.legalzoom.com/article/how-do-i-correctly-format-copyright) for more infomation. If this document were copyrighted, it would look like:

```Â© 2021, DigitalReplica, LLC.```

Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/) offers several licenses to provide flexible ways to share your work.

Best practice is to add a file to your repository named ```LICENSE.txt``` to your repo with the license text in it. See [Licensing a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository). Alternately, you can add your license as a snippet in your ```README.md``` file.

## Add a 'notes` topic
GitHub allowed each repo to be [classified with a topic](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics). By tagging your notes with the [notes](https://github.com/topics/notes) topic, others can more easily find them.

## Add sponsors
GitHub adds a [sponsor button]https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository) to your repo when the special file ```.github/FUNDING.yml``` is added. You can add your sponsorship links to provide ways to support your work.

# Private notes
Not all notes will be public, so this section explores different methods to either share private notes with a community, or make them totally private so only you can access.

## Private shared repos
Cloud git providers host the private source code for many companies, so they have some of the most secure software in the world: [GitHub](https://github.com/security), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/security/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/cloud-security).

GitHub
* [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) a private notes repository.
* [Add collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)

## Private repos
Create a private repo, and don't give anyone access to it. Only you will be able to see the contents.

## Using private hosting
Hosting a private git server requires a bit more technical knowledge, but there are plenty of guides for how to do this. [Git on the Server](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server) is a good starting point.

## Using other cloud storage providers
A git repository can be hosted in a folder of any cloud storage or file sharing mechanism. It can be kept completely private, or shared with others. It requires some git command line knowledge, and [Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) is a good reference.

## Local or encrypted storage
The most secure method is using local storage, which can be your computer, a thumb drive, or file server. Encrypting the storage device before using adds additional security (but is beyond the scope of this guide.) Creating a local git repo is exactly the same as the cloud storage option, using the command line and [Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) reference.

# Organizing notes
This section looks on how to organize notes within a git-notes repo. It's very much a work in progress, with multiple approaches being tried. Read through these principals and see what works.

## Prefer unchanging note filenames
Changing the filename of a note breaks links. While this can be fixed with a search and replace in your notes, it still breaks other people linking to your public notes.

## Prefer larger, fewer files
Notes are at first a quick way to remember things, then a dumping ground of everything related to a topic. But hopefully what emerges is an ever more organized understanding of it. That process takes time and editing, which is easier to to in a single file.

## Densely link topics
Linking makes it easier to hop from topic to topic, idea to idea. It reinforces recall through repetition.

## Prefer flat file structures
When creating new note files, keep them all in the same directory when possible. This makes relative linking within notes much easier

# git-knowledge
Once comfortable that git-notes is useful and working, take a look at [git-knowledge](https://github.com/digitalreplica/git-knowledge) for a method of linking multiple repos together into a larger knowledge system.
