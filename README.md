# About
Git Notes is a git-centric approach to taking notes, built around simple rules.

## One Repo per Concept
Each git-notes repo should encompass a single concept, containing all notes pertaining to that concept.

## Notes are Markdown
[Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) is a human-focused text format, easily readable and writable by anyone. This note is written in markdown, showing how easy it is.

# Getting Started
1. Create a new git repository. Or use [git-notes-template](https://github.com/digitalreplica/git-notes-template) as a template or `git clone`
2. Edit the README.md file
